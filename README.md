### Forecasting Ferry Ticket Redemptions & Sales - Applied Scientist Technical Test

**Opportunity No. 44081**

## Project Summary

This project improves upon an existing forecasting model for **ferry ticket redemptions** and develops a new model for **ticket sales** using Toronto Island Park data. The models account for seasonality, spikes, and business behavior. The approach emphasizes explainability, reproducibility, and sound development workflow.

## Objectives

- Improve baseline redemption forecast
- Build a new ticket sales forecast
- Ensure business-aligned modeling assumptions
- Communicate results clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

---

## Key Features

- **Baseline Model**: Seasonal decomposition
- **Prophet Model**: Captures weekly and yearly patterns using additive models
- **XGBoost with Residual Correction**: Addresses spikes and nonlinearities
- **Sales Forecasting**: Implemented separately in `SalesCountForcasting.ipynb`
- **Explainability**: SHAP values and gain-based feature importance
- **Diagnostics**: Q-Q plots, residual distribution, fold-wise error metrics

---

## Assumptions

- Focus is on post-2022 (post-COVID) ferry usage trends, as this period reflects more stable and consistent behavior, free from major disruptions or anomalies.
- Redemption is a function of lagged sales, calendar seasonality, and recent demand.
- Real-time sales data is not available for same-day forecasting (lagged features used).

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Create environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mb-ds-project
```

Or use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

`SalesCountForecasting.ipynb` for forecasting Sales Count is an independent Jupyter Notebook with comments, notes, and observations.

To run the modeling pipeline:
```python
from Model import RedemptionModel

model = RedemptionModel(X=df, target_col='Redemption Count')
model.run_models()
model.plot_residual_distribution("XGBoost+Residuals")
model.train_final_model_and_show_explainability()
```
